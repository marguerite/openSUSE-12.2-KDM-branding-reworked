# openSUSE 12.2 KDM branding - Reworked!

It seems the KDM branding of openSUSE 12.2 has been criticized a lot because it seems to be created in a hurry.

So I just polished it a little bit.

## Installation

* Uncompress and place into /usr/share/kde4/apps/kdm/themes/
* In YaST, use this theme.

NOTE: I just worked the normal user login mode, other modes like remote login mode may looks even more ugly than before.
if you had such hardware and test environment. please help me finish that parts.
